# pixelfed_ynh
The federated image shareing service Pixelfed, for YunoHost

**Shipped version:** NONE, THIS PACKAGE DOESN'T WORK YET!

I'm waiting for an official release (alpha/beta or stable) to invest more time on this package. 
Don't hesitate to give a hand if you wish, I assume only the nginx file needs improvments.
